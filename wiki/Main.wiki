The X-Transport library allows you to develop a data access part as fast as possible.

Your system should support NET 4.0

= Features =
 * Supports client-server architecture, also allow to locate server and client in one app.
 * Data mapping description on a client side only.
 * The journaling. You can get all data on any moment of history.
 * The built-in version. Allow you to undo/redo/revert each change.
 * Multy-user. Each user can connect to the server by the one or multiple sessions.
 * "Mirroring". Allow to work with object by some different types.
 * Compatibility. You can change your storeable object but database wont stay incompatible.

I think that examples will help me to open whole potential of the X-Transport.
